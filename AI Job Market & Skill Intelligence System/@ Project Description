Project Title

AI Job Market & Skill Intelligence System

📄 Project Description

This project analyzes the AI job market using real-world job listing data to understand skill demand, salary trends, and the impact of AI adoption across industries. It combines Data Analytics, Machine Learning, NLP, and Business Intelligence to build a complete intelligent system that can predict salaries, clean and standardize job skills, recommend suitable job roles based on user skills, and visualize job market insights through interactive dashboards. The project simulates an industry-level end-to-end data science workflow using a single dataset.

❓ Why This Project

To gain hands-on experience in the complete data science lifecycle

To understand real job market trends in AI and Data Science

To practice EDA, Machine Learning, NLP, and Dashboarding in one project

To build a portfolio-grade project instead of small disconnected tasks

To prepare for internships, placements, and startup ideas

To demonstrate the ability to turn raw data into business insights and intelligent systems

This project shows that you can work not only as a Data Analyst but also as a Data Scientist and AI Engineer.
